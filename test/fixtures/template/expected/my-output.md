### GET

To charge a credit card, you create a charge object. If your API key is in test mode, the supplied payment source (e.g., card or Bitcoin receiver) won&#x27;t actually be charged, though everything else will occur as if in live mode. (Stripe assumes that the charge would have completed successfully).
